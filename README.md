# tumblr

This is the repository for all my [tumblr themes](https://5ppi.tumblr.com). 

## How-To

You will find the html files in  `[Theme_Name] > theme > [theme_name].html`. Copy and paste the raw text into your tumblr blog's customize page.

Documentation for each theme is in `[Theme_Name] > theme > documentation.md`.

Additionally, this information is usually mirrored on [tumblr](https://5ppi.tumblr.com) in a more user-friendly manner.

## Finished Themes

1. Lemon
2. 404
3. Very Boring Theme
4. Hypertext Markup Language
5. Facebook
6. 4chan
7. Highlighter

If you see a theme in the repository that is not in this list, DO NOT install it. It is in development. Wait for the release post on tumblr.

## Terms of Use

### Credit 

You can modify the themes as you wish, but leave my credit links alone. This includes the credit inside comments as well.

However, you can put a small piece of one of my themes into another theme by someone else. In this case, you may leave out visible credit, as long as it is not a major part of the resulting theme. You must still credit me somewhere in the code with this:

```
<!-- [sidebar, header, script, etc.] by spacetchi, Medusa Moxie 

http://spacetchi.tumblr.com/

http://5ppi.tumblr.com/

http://tchi.space/

-->
```

Also check with the creator of the other theme to make sure they're okay with that. 

### Redistribution

Because this repository is updated continuously, your copies of my codes will become outdated. For this reason, do not re-host without my explicit permission. If you want my themes to be accessible to users who are unable to access GitHub for some reason, please message me before uploading somewhere else. I will see what I can do.

### Base Code

You may use this without any credit whatsoever, and sell themes based on it.

## Pull Requests

If you see a problem with a theme, go ahead and send a pull request.
