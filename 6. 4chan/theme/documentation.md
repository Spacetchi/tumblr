Default styling is 4chan's Yotsuba theme. Option explanations and additional information below. 

### Banner 

Can be any image and size you want. Make it 300px by 100px if you want it to look like 4chan.

### Background 

Make this the same as `Gradient Bottom` if you have `Gradient Background` turned on. Just to support IE6 and the like.

### Reply

Background of replies to a post, post notes on permalink page, and pagination. 

### Post Title

Color of text in post titles.

### Names

Color of OP's name; either 'Anonymous' or ReblogRootName.

### Line

Color of borders.

### Meme Arrows

Color of `>quoted` text. Default is 4chan styling. I don't recommend changing this.

### Font

A selection of fonts. Many of them are bad. I suggest using Georgia, Helvetica, Lucida Sans, or Verdana.

### Gradient Background

Switches between regular background and background with a gradient. Default ON.

### Anonymous

Switches between using 'Anonymous' and the name of the OP in the name field. Default ON.

### Spoiler Text

If ON, `<s>`, `<strike>`, `<del>` are rendered like 4chan spoilers. Default ON.

### Borders

Toggles borders on post replies, post notes, and pagination. Default ON.

### Infinite Scroll

Toggles infinite scroll, which only works on the first page (that's how it is on 4chan). Default ON.
