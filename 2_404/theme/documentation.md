# 404 Theme

**I did not make this theme**.

This theme is literally made by opening up a Not Found page on tumblr and copying all of its contents via view-source. The only adjustment I have made is removing the tumblr controls. You can do it yourself if you know how. 

tumblr changes a lot, so I have to update this frequently. This means, in order for this theme to really do its job, you have to re-install the theme frequently, too.

The most recent version of the theme will always be located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spacetchi/tumblr/master/2.%20404/theme/404.html).

Please notify me (via tumblr) if you've noticed that this theme has gone out of date! I will update it as soon as possible.
